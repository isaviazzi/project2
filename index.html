    In other words: I am not the sum of my personal data. I am not identical to the digital information that is constantly being collected on me and around me, no matter where I am or what I am doing. Of course, while I am not my personal data, I am increasingly represented by it in what I do, in my work and my leisure time. I am represented by personal data relating to my friends and acquaintances, my university, my employer, the government, security forces, etc. But what makes this situation even more troubling is that I increasingly present myself through my personal data. Even more curious, I am most often complicit in the systematic collection of my personal data. I seek it out, even desire it.

    Of course, people are going to have to get used to the idea that banks are going to be able to not only track data but also know where you are at all times. This could seem a little invasive, but it seems like banks are certain that people will come around once this technology becomes more widely used.
  Some fear that they might spike prices for people who are making poor lifestyle choices, even though most of the time these choices are based on misinformation through no fault of the people being tracked. This could lead to higher prices for people who cannot pay more. Still, this fear is not slowing down this industry as they continue to invest in data tracking tech, including mobile trackers.
