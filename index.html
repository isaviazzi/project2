    In other words: I am not the sum of my personal data. I am not identical to the digital information that is constantly being collected on me and around me, no matter where I am or what I am doing. Of course, while I am not my personal data, I am increasingly represented by it in what I do, in my work and my leisure time. I am represented by personal data relating to my friends and acquaintances, my university, my employer, the government, security forces, etc. But what makes this situation even more troubling is that I increasingly present myself through my personal data. Even more curious, I am most often complicit in the systematic collection of my personal data. I seek it out, even desire it.

        My world turned upside down. So many dissapointments. I am one person on one side and I can't recognize myself in the other. What changed? Is this still me? Does it matter? I am scared. What if my data si sold to companies and they think I am a lesser viable customer. Will this affect my loan potential? Do I still qualify for proper health care or insurance? Now what?
